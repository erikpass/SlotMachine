# SlotMachine
Added all the functionality that was listed on the README file with the task.
Visuals are not very good due to most time going on the functionality.
Slot machine animation is with JS and most of the JS is fairly bundled together in one script, however a lot of it is in various functions that could be easily decoupled if necessary.
The reel animations might be backwards (spinning upwards instead of downwards), but it does not really change the function of the slot machine.
